        A variable is a changeable value recorded in Scratch's memory. Variables can only hold one value at a time, unlike lists. These values can be either numbers or strings — any text. Clicking on an isolated variable in the scripts area displays a small bubble reporting the value of the variable. Unlike many other programming languages, Scratch does not allow variables to be created by a script as it runs. Instead, variables are created with the "Make a Variable" button in the Block Palette. Lists allow multiple values to be stored, acting like a group of variable
